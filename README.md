This is my group project for Data Structure class.
## Data Structure Project

The details of FSKTM students such as Student Id, Name, Program, and CGPA to be managed. The list indicates both alphabetical ordering of names, ascending order of Student Id Number and alphabetical ordering of department names .
Perform the following,
* Insert a new student detail in the appropriate position
* Remove a student detail where Student Id is given
* Find a student detail whose ID is given.
* Find student information whose name in a particular program is given.
* List all student detail in order of their name.

### Method
We decided to implement Linear Data Structure which is Singly Linked List to sort user data input.

### Justification
The justification for choosing singly linked list data structure is because as a dynamic data structure it can expand and shrink at execution by memory allocating and memory deallocating. As a result, the singly linked list’s initial result is not needed. Furthermore, in singly linked list the operations of insertion and deletion are quite simpler. Unlike array, in singly linked list after insertion and deletion of the elements, the shifting of elements is not needed and only needs to updated the address present in the next pointer of a node.

### Title
FSKTM student list mangement system

### About
FSKTM student list management system is a code that write in C programming for managing FSKTM student system that aims to store FSKTM student detail in a list with alphabetically order. It is enable student or admin to add detail, delete detail, show detail or specific detail.
It comes with optimizations that low memory needed to install or run the system. It give advantage to FSKTM admin to store student detail as the program are easy to use and save memory. Each command has been fine-tuned to enableall of the system’s capabilities and it assist user in storing student detail.
### Installation
    1. Download the studentSystem.c file.
    2. Download Dev-c++, Virtual Studio Code or Code Blocks (if you had download it, skip to step 3).
    3. Launch the system by clicking on the file that you had downloaded in your file explorer. 
### User guide
    1. When you had launch the system, you will be redirect to a home menu.
    2. Choose the menu
    3. Choice 1, you need to enter student detail such as student ID, name, program, and CGPA.
    4. Choice 2, you can delete any of student detail by entering stuent ID.
    5. Choice 3, you can acces to particular stuednt detail by entering student ID.
    6. Choice 4, you can acces student detail that are enroll in particular program as you enter the program.
    7. Choice 5, you can acces to all student detail. The student detail will be sorted in alphabetical order.
    8. Choice 6 , you can exit the program by entering number 6.
### Features
    1. Optimize memory allocation.
    2. Documented commands.
    3. Easy to use.
